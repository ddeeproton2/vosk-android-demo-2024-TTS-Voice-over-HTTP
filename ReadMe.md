Vosk Android demo - upgraded 2024
Added features:
-Switch to audio bluetooth if aviable
-Continue to run in background
-Send the text of your voice over GET HTTPS (not HTTP, because Android limitations)
-Recieve voice to speak on your phone into a Web server in HTTP (not HTTPS, because it's the simpliest way for me, help appreciated).

Then, this voice assistant can be merged with any other server script. Like PHP, NodeJS, ... Any other language allowing to create a web server in HTTPS, and request GET in HTTP to communicate with this Android apk.

This project is compiled for French language. I will, translate it others languages "if I have time for it" and disk space here. 
But from now, you can compile yourself in your langage by downloading your model from Vosk website, and compile this with Android Studio (configuration modification is requested. Found them with "the directory name" of the model used).

This project is a merging of others projects. I let everything as it was. So many things is aviable but I did not used them.

Thanks to all contributors. :)

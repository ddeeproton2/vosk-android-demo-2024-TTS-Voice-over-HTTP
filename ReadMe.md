Vosk Android demo - upgraded 2024

1. Speak to your phone, and send command over HTTPS

2. Make your phone to speak, from others applications over HTTP.

3. Switch to audio bluetooth if aviable, or use your main microphone in last ressort.

4. Continue to run in background

____________________________

On the server part:

The server will recieve a get request like this

https://everythingyouwant/mymessage

And the server can respond to your phone with

http://your_ip_phone/?message=mymessage

You must script this part. But this is why this application is cool :)
____________________________

This project is compiled for French language. I will, translate it others languages "if I have time for it" and disk space here. 
But from now, you can compile yourself in your langage by downloading your model from Vosk website, and compile this with Android Studio (configuration modification is requested).

You will need to download a text voice assistant also (from Samsung store). In this case in French, to make your phone speaking.

This project is a merging of others projects. I let everything as it was it this repository.

Thanks to all contributors. :)
